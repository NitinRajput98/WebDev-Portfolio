# Nitin Rajput's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website hosted at [nitinrajputportfolio.netlify.app](https://nitinrajputportfolio.netlify.app). This site showcases my projects, skills, and professional journey as a developer. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Parcel as the bundler for efficient asset management.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the site looks great on all devices from phones to desktops.
- **Modern Styling**: Utilizes CSS and JavaScript for clean, professional aesthetics.
- **Performance Optimized**: Bundled with Parcel for fast loading times.

## Local Development

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NitinRajput98/WebDev-Portfolio.git
   cd WebDev-Portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will start the Parcel bundler and serve the project at `localhost:1234` by default.

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Netlify. Any pushes to the main branch trigger a build and deployment process automatically via Netlify's continuous deployment system.
